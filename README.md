#Python Functions

*arb_args - Takes in any number of arguments and prints them one at a time. <br><br>
*inner_func - Takes in two integers. Two nested functions should perform separate, distinct math operations using the integers. The result of both nested functions should then be added together and printed.<br><br>
*lunch_lady - Takes in two strings: a student's name and their lunch preference. The function should print both strings. If a lunch preference is not given, "Mystery Meat" should be printed instead.<br><br>
*sum_n_product - Accepts two integers and returns both the sum and the product.<br><br>
alias_arb_args - Should be arb_args but assigned an alias. Remember, variables can hold functions in Python just like they can in JS. Alternatively, you can call a function from inside another function.<br><br>
*arb_mean - Accepts any number of integers and prints their average.<br><br>
*arb_longest_string - Accepts any number of strings and returns the longest one.
